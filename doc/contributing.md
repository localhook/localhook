Reporting an issue or a feature request
---------------------------------------

Issues and feature requests are tracked in the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/localhook/localhook-server/issues).

When reporting a bug, it may be a good idea to reproduce it in a basic project built using the [Symfony Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) to allow developers of the project to reproduce the issue by simply cloning it and following some steps.
