Localhook
=========

Webhooks is a common thing in API world. This feature is very useful.

Therefore, it's not always easy to deal with it for developers:

- Some API required you to use HTTPS only (and not "self authenticated").
- The webhook listener has to be available on the web. Sometime **it's not possible to give a web access to your local version** of a project (entreprise proxy, etc).

Localhook is solution to help developers to work with webhooks in development context.
